#  NodeMCU + DS18B20 medical data analysis
## Getting Started
 An IOT based system for medical data collection and analysis. This application runs on an WiFi connected ESP8266 NodeMCU which gets readings from a Dallas DS18B20 temperature sensor (later on a MELEXIS sensor). Data are uploaded on a constant basis into ThingSpeak (https://thingspeak.com) cloud data analysis service where are processed and dipslayed accordingly.
 
### Prerequisites

A NodeMCU 8266 development board
A Dallas 18B20 temperature sensor
Adruino IDE

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
